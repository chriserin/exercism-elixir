** (SyntaxError) account.exs:48: unexpected keyword "do:". In case you wanted to write a "do" expression, you must either separate the keyword argument with comma or use do-blocks. For example, the following construct:

    if some_condition? do
      :this
    else
      :that
    end

is syntax sugar for the Elixir construct:

    if(some_condition?, do: :this, else: :that)

where "some_condition?" is the first argument and the second argument is a keyword list.

Syntax error before: 'do:'
